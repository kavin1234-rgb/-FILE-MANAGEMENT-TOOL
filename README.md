 **The C++ File Management Tool is a simple yet effective program that allows users to create, write, read, and delete text files. It is particularly useful for personal file management, where users can store notes, logs, or important records efficiently. In educational settings, students can use it to learn file handling concepts in C++ and practice working with files. Software developers can integrate it into applications that require basic file storage, such as managing configuration files or log files. Additionally, it can be used in data logging systems, where storing and retrieving information from text files is necessary, such as in IoT applications and automation processes. The tool is also applicable in simple database management scenarios, where storing small records in text files eliminates the need for complex database systems. System administrators can use it for automation and scripting purposes, such as logging system events or batch processingÂ files.**
